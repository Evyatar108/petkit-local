"""The W7H (EverSweet Ultra AI) fountain, pinned to a real report.

This model shares a category with the Bluetooth EverSweets and almost no fields
with them, so it is the case where "the fountain parser" and "what this device
sends" are two different things. Everything here is checked against one real
`property/post` captured from a W7H on 2026-07-31, cross-checked field for field
against a reverse-engineered map of the same firmware's `ctrl`.

The payload below is that capture with three substitutions, each of which the
assertions are independent of: the `XDevice` signing credential is removed
(`ingest.telemetry_only` strips it anyway, and it does not belong in a public
repo), and the SSID/BSSID/IP are replaced with placeholders — the IP with a
TEST-NET-1 address so the `other`-string parse is still exercised.
